"""
The DatabaseHistoryManager is like a dictionary that can cache historical versions of the values.
The class consists of the temporary database in RAM, the cache on disk and a way to pull from the original data source.
The temporary database:
    This is a normal dictionary in RAM.
    When accessing and modifying data this is the data you are modifying.
The cache on disk:
    This is a database on disk of the data serialised using pickle.
    This is populated with the original version of the data and each revision of the data.
    The temporary database can be cleared using the unload methods and successive get calls will re-populate the temporary database from this cache.
    As previously stated, the cache also stores historical versions of the data which enables undoing and redoing changes.
The original data source (raw form)
    This is the original data from the world/structure.
    If the data does not exist in the temporary or cache databases it will be loaded from here.
